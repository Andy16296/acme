Having a problem finishing this part of the course.

Having gone throught the video from running the command ,, sudo bash install.sh and the password for Maria DB all was well.. then editing the vagrantfile and saving it all was well.

Then typing exit at the vagrant prompt, as it tells you to, it all went pear shaped. The screen closed. I wasn't able to type the next command  vagrant reload.

so re-opened Putty again to restart.
entered the username vagrant
entered the password vagrant
it wouldn't take the password. did this some more time... no joy..

restarted windows 10.
opened up putty again and now it says
PuTTy Fatel error
network error :  Connection refused
Putty inactive
cant enter any thing now.
into the putty window

When all this was happing the command prompt was saying that vagrant wasn't installed.

Thanks Andy

Hello Mr Sawler
Question on the validation down load files. for Lecture 31

The file shows this code :

 if (($first_name == "")
    || ($last_name == "")
    || ($username == "")
    || ($verify_username == "")
    || ($verify_password == "")
    || ($last_name == "")) {
      header("Location: /register.html");
      exit();
    }
should it be this, if not could you explain why :

if (($first_name == "")
  || ($last_name == "")
  || ($username == "")
  || ($verify_username == "")
  || ($password == "")
  || ($verify_password == "")) {
    header("Location: /register.html");
    exit();
  }

Thanks andy
